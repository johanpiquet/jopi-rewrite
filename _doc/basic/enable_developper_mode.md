# Enable developer mode

Developer mode enables features that improve productivity:

- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for React components.
- Verbose logging and helpful error overlays.
- Automatic rebuilds on file changes.

How to enable:
- Set `NODE_ENV=development` or use the project's dev script.
- Run the dev server (e.g., `bun run dev` or `npm run dev`).

Recommendations:
- Use developer mode only in local environments.
- Disable verbose features in production for performance and security.
