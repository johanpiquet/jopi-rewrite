## Node.js or Bun.js

Jopi Rewrite is designed to work with `node.js` and `bun.js`, which is an alternative to `Node.js`.

> If you want high performances, complet multi-website, DDOS protection and hot-reload,
> then you must use `bun.js`, since this features can't be implemented with Node.js.

The first step to working with Jopi Rewrite is therefore to install Node.js, or Bun.js.

## How to install Bun.js

> [!NOTE]  
> If you already have Node.js installed: `npm install bun -g`.  
> For Linux & MacOS: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.  
> For Windows: `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"`.

> [!TIP]  
>Bun.js is highly compatible with Node.js and many things are similar.
>* You use `bun` where you used to use `node`.  
>  For example: `bun install` and `bun run start`.
>
>* Bun can directly run Typescript files: `bun index.ts`
