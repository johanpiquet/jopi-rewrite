Jopi Rewrite is a framework for *bun.js* that integrates a set of technologies to build powerful server applications.
It is very fast (thanks to bun.js) and very simple to use: that is its strength.

With Jopi Rewrite you will quickly be able to:

âœ“ Build a **high-performance** server application.  
âœ“ Do **React SSR** and **React Hydrate** (like NextJS).  
âœ“ Use **JWT Token** for authentification.  
... all this very simply, thanks to a very simple framework.

But it's not the main point, since with Jopi Rewrite you can also:

âœ“ Build a smart **cache** server.  
âœ“ Build a smart proxy with **load-balancing**.  
âœ“ Build a powerful site **crawler**.

One of the nice things with Jopi Rewrite, is **hot reload**. Hot-reload allows updating our code and see our server do
a automatic restart: but without stopping what he is doing. If he is processing requests, then the server will continue
to process them, and in the same time the new version will process the new incoming requests.

âœ“ **Hot-reload is like with PHP**: you can update your server without breaking what he is currently doing.  
âœ“ Server update can be done safely, and when you want.  
âœ“ This without latencies: important things can be kept in memory, like caches.
